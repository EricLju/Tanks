# Tanks!
**Introduction**

Tanks! is a mini-game where you search out and destroy enemy missile launching
platforms before they launch their missile. Destroy enemy tanks while avoiding
enemy fire along the way. Pick up spinning wrench icons to gain extra lives.

Use the ARROW KEYS to MOVE and SPACE to FIRE.

This started out a side project to make a small and barebones 3D engine that 
only called 2D drawing HTML5 Canvas functions. I took a class on computer
graphics that covered 3D to 2D projection but we never implemented it ourselves
and so I wanted to do it to better understand the subject. Once I had a 
spinning cube displaying correctly I decided I wanted to make a game to
expand on the project.

I've included a demo project of just the 3D Engine Code below:
